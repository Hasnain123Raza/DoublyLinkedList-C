# Doubly Linked List Data Structure

## Definition

Doubly linked list is an implementation of the list abstract data type. It consists of a header structure that contains some metadata such as length and pointers to the head and tail of a list made out of a series of node structures, each containing a pointer to the previous and next ones.

## Interface

The functions provided to interface with this doubly linked list implementation are divided into three categories:

1. Constructor and Destructor
2. Common List Abstract Data Type Functions
3. Functions Unique to Doubly Linked List

Read the comments in the header file (./includes/DoublyLinkedList.h) to learn more.

## Usage

Clone this git repository, navigate to its root, and run make command.

This will generate two folders:

- bin
- build

bin contains a driver executable that is used for testing.
build contains a .a static library and a .so dynamic library.
